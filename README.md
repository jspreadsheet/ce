### Basic demo

A basic example to integrate the JavaScript spreadsheet in your website to create your first online spreadsheet.

```html
<script src="https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v4/jexcel.js"></script>
<script src="https://bossanova.uk/jsuites/v2/jsuites.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bossanova.uk/jsuites/v2/jsuites.css" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v4/jexcel.css" type="text/css" />
```

```html
<div id="spreadsheet"></div>
```

```javascript
var data = [
    ['Jazz', 'Honda', '2019-02-12', '', true, '$ 2.000,00', '#777700'],
    ['Civic', 'Honda', '2018-07-11', '', true, '$ 4.000,01', '#007777'],
];

jexcel(document.getElementById('spreadsheet'), {
    data:data,
    columns: [
        { type: 'text', title:'Car', width:120 },
        { type: 'dropdown', title:'Make', width:200, source:[ "Alfa Romeo", "Audi", "Bmw" ] },
