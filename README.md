### CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspreadsheet-ce/dist/index.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspreadsheet-ce/dist/jspreadsheet.min.css" type="text/css" />

```

### Basic Demo

A basic example to integrate the Jspreadsheet in your website to create your first data grid with spreadsheet controls. <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/qBRzXKK>


#### Usage

Add jexcel/jspreadsheet and Jsuites to your html file

```html
<script src="https://bossanova.uk/jspreadsheet/v5/jspreadsheet.js"></script>
<script src="https://jsuites.net/v5/jsuites.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bossanova.uk/jspreadsheet/v5/jspreadsheet.css" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://jsuites.net/v5/jsuites.css" type="text/css" />
```

You should initialize your data grid on a div container, such as:

```html
<div id="spreadsheet"></div>
```

To initialize a Jspreadsheet CE table you should run JavaScript, such as:

```javascript
jspreadsheet(document.getElementById('spreadsheet'), {
    worksheets: [{
        data: [
            ['Jazz', 'Honda', '2019-02-12', '', true, '$ 2.000,00', '#777700'],
            ['Civic', 'Honda', '2018-07-11', '', true, '$ 4.000,01', '#007777'],
        ],
        columns: [
            { type: 'text', title:'Car', width:120 },
            { type: 'dropdown', title:'Make', width:200, source:[ "Alfa Romeo", "Audi", "Bmw", "Honda" ] },
            { type: 'calendar', title:'Available', width:200 },
            { type: 'image', title:'Photo', width:120 },
            { type: 'checkbox', title:'Stock', width:80 },
            { type: 'numeric', title:'Price', width:100, mask:'$ #.##,00', decimal:',' },
            { type: 'color', width:100, render:'square', }
        ]
    }]
});
```

Serve your html file and then you will get the rendered table in your browser
